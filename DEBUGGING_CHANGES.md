# Debugging Changes for AI-Readable Extension

## Problem Identified
The extension was showing duplicate tables in different formats because:

1. **Content Hierarchy Extraction** was processing table content as part of regular content
2. **Table Extraction** was separately processing the same content using different strategies
3. **Ineffective Deduplication** was failing to recognize when the same data was formatted differently

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Table Deduplication (`extractTables` method)
- Added `processedTableElements` Set to track processed DOM elements
- Added `normalizeTableContent()` method to create comparable content for deduplication
- Enhanced each extraction strategy to check both content and element deduplication
- Added comprehensive logging to track the extraction process

### 2. Improved Content Hierarchy Extraction (`extractContentHierarchy` method)
- Enhanced `isTableRelated()` detection to identify table-like content more accurately
- Added checks to skip table-related headings and paragraphs
- Improved element tracking to prevent processing the same content multiple times
- Added logging to track what content is being processed vs. skipped

### 3. Enhanced Table Detection (`isTableRelated` method)
- Added detection for div elements with table-like patterns
- Enhanced class-based detection with additional keywords (benchmark, metrics, stats)
- Added detection for elements containing table-like children
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. Better Content Association (`getAssociatedContent` method)
- Improved logic to skip table-related content
- Better handling of already-processed elements
- Cleaner flow to prevent duplicate processing

### 5. New Helper Methods
- `normalizeTableContent()`: Normalizes table content for comparison
- `isContentAlreadyInTable()`: Checks if content is within already-processed table structures

## How the Fix Works

1. **Element-Level Tracking**: Each DOM element is tracked to prevent multiple processing
2. **Content Normalization**: Table content is normalized (removing formatting, normalizing whitespace) for comparison
3. **Strategy Coordination**: All table extraction strategies now coordinate to avoid duplicates
4. **Early Detection**: Table-related content is detected early in the content hierarchy extraction and skipped

## Testing

A test page (`test-page.html`) has been created that contains:
- Standard HTML tables
- Pre-formatted markdown tables
- Custom div structures with table-like data
- Multiple representations of the same data

This allows verification that:
- Only one version of each table appears in the output
- No duplicate content is processed
- All table formats are properly detected and handled

## Debugging

Comprehensive logging has been added to help track:
- Which elements are being processed
- What content is being skipped and why
- How many tables are extracted by each strategy
- Total tables processed

## Expected Results

After these changes, the extension should:
1. Show each table only once
2. Choose the best format for each table (prioritizing pre-formatted > HTML > custom)
3. Not duplicate content between content hierarchy and table extraction
4. Provide clear logging for debugging any remaining issues

## Next Steps

1. Test the extension on the test page
2. Verify no duplicate tables appear
3. Check console logs for debugging information
4. Test on real websites to ensure the fix works in production
